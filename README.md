# A-good-movie

To do list:

Phase 1: DONE
 - scrape movie reviews
 - create and clean dataframe
 
Phase 2:
 - apply NLP ML/ RNN algo
 - check the understanding of the NN.
 - consider increasing the training load with other review from different sources (IMBD, rotten tomatoes)
 
Phase 3:
 - apply ML algo to forecast Ebert score
 - maybe possible to look for correlation between score and success?
